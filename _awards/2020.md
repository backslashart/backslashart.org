  Inspired by a Biblical Hebrew phrase found in the Genesis creation narrative that describes the condition of the earth immediately before the creation of light, often interpreted as "without form, and void", Tohuwabohu is a nonlinear universal media control app for live performances developed in React.js and Electron.
  
  Performance essays is a multimodal approach to conveying ideas and concepts to an audience by taking advantage of the many avenues of perception by humans. When we see the media we must ask how we believe we can interact with it. How do we connect, modify, and layer different media types? How do these interactions extend into the physical space? How do we generalize an all-media "instrument"?
  
  From the layout to the actual functionality, Tohuwabohu gives a user much flexibility to do whatever they want instead of predefining everything. A bit of chaotic energy at first, maybe you don't know what this button does, or where the window went (as everything is movable); but as you get a hang of it, it becomes a good partner of yours.
  
  Features include:
  - Preloading performance files
  - Adding local file and YouTube videos on the fly with thumbnails
  - Reorderable playlist in 1D/list and 2D/grid layout
  - Multiple resizable previews
  - Audio recording of the performance
  - Text window with basic WYSIWYG
  - Overlay canvas for live free-hand drawing
  - Each component is draggable to anywhere with in the app screen, collapsable anytime
  - MIDI support, fullscreen, hotkey binding, dark mode>
