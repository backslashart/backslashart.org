Over the duration of our time at Cornell Tech, we have shared the idea that technology has the potential to be used in a broader way than we commonly see today: in a conscientious and human-centric manner and as a powerful tool for ends other than its own sake. We believe that if used in a deliberate and careful manner, it has the potential to harmoniously work with the concept of the artwork and enable altogether new forms of communication and relationships between the viewer and piece.

The notion of “anti-interactivity” was fascinating because it allowed us the opportunity to try and unobtrusively integrate technology into the fabric of an artwork. In fact, this turned out to be the very definition of anti-interactivity we arrived at: that it not be a distraction or focus but instead create an environment that is subtly aware, conscious just as the world around us is.

Our previous experience with computer graphics, computer vision and game engine software aligned with the need to create a system of sensors that could process input signals and intelligently interpret them to feed into a game engine (in this case, Unreal Engine), and so affect the rendering of ‘The Living End’ in real-time and give it life.
