## > \ART FELLOWSHIP AT CORNELL TECH \-\- CALL FOR PROPOSALS

\Art, pronounced “backslash art”, awards an annual fellowship to a visiting artist to collaborate with Cornell Tech faculty and students on a significant work of art that engages bleeding-edge digital research and technology. The fellowship offers sustained teamwork with creative and innovative technologists, enabling deep exploration of new artistic forms, expressions and features, and is intended to provoke novel opportunities for the artist’s work.

\Art takes its name from the \ (backslash) “escape” character in computer programming, used to indicate that whatever comes after the \ should be interpreted outside the normal mode of input and output to do something special. In this spirit, the \Art Fellowship provokes the artist to escape convention in their practice. 

\Art lives at Cornell Tech, a digital-age graduate campus of Cornell University in New York City. \Art collides students, faculty, and artists, both on and off campus, providing grants and support for unconventional works that use the latest emerging digital technologies. Combined Cornell University’s founding principle -- “... any person ... any study” -- \Art creates an ideal ground for high-tech, transdisciplinary collaborations. 

\Art is currently accepting artist proposals for the **2024 \Art Fellowship**.

Cornell University embraces diversity and seeks candidates who will contribute to a climate that supports students, faculty and staff of all identities and backgrounds. We strongly encourage individuals from underrepresented and/or marginalized identities to apply. Our inclusive community of scholars, students and staff impart an uncommon sense of larger purpose and contribute creative ideas to further the university's mission of teaching, discovery and engagement.

## >  FELLOWSHIP DETAILS

As recipient of the \Art Fellowship, the artist is awarded:

- **Appointment**. The artist receives a one-year Visiting Artist appointment at Cornell Tech, beginning September 2024 with the start of the 2024–25 academic year. Note that this fellowship recognizes the artist themself and is an individual paid appointment at Cornell, not a contractual agreement with the artist’s studio.
 
- **Honorarium**. The artist receives a $20,000 stipend in recognition of their commitment to pursue a new collaborative work engaging contemporary technology.

- **Travel support**. The artist receives up to $20,000 support to visit Cornell Tech in New York City, and is anticipated to spend no less than a month on campus over the course of the year. The artist can book a room at the Graduate Hotel on Cornell Tech’s campus or make other arrangements.

- **Project materials**. \Art provides up to $10,000 support for project materials.

- **Studio space**. The artist receives studio space on campus for the academic year.

- **Faculty home**. The artist collaborates with a primary faculty member and their research group, based on the technology area of the artist’s proposed work (see Technology Areas below). When the artist is on campus, they can participate in group meetings, lunches, seminars, etc.

- **Student support**. \Art provides up to $10,000 support for PhD and Masters students who are committed to working with the artist on the project. In addition to collaborating with the primary faculty member and their research group, students from across campus are invited to contribute to the project, given the software development and other needs of the work, and based on student applications. 

## > TECHNOLOGY AREAS

Cornell Tech faculty are passionate about making an impact, both on campus and in the world beyond. They have a vision for the power of technology and are motivated by the opportunity to conduct innovative research and co-create with leading academics, entrepreneurs, industry experts, students, and artists!

The following are active technology areas of Cornell Tech research that the artist should consider when making a proposal. Collaborations in these inspiring areas can result in exceptional work that is not possible through the use of generally available software or software developers the artist could contract on their own.

- **Public interaction with autonomous systems**. The way that people perceive, interact and react to autonomous systems in public spaces will make or break technologies from autonomous cars to robotic systems. Systems that allow machines to perceive and to respond to human responses lay the ground to socially appropriate interaction. Wendy Ju. [https://wendyju.com/](https://wendyju.com/)

- **Computational/digital fabrication**. Fabrication technology is transforming from being a pure industry-driven technology towards a technology that can directly be used by the 99.9% of users who currently do not have access to this. This will open up a wide variety of new, diverse, and impactful applications of fabrication that stretch far beyond the mass-production or prototyping we have seen in the past. To this end, my lab is equipped with various 3D printers, laser cutters, wire benders, pick and place machines etc. Thijs Roumen. [http://www.matteroftechlab.org](http://www.matteroftechlab.org)

- **Virtual and augmented reality**. The XR Collaboratory accelerates activities in augmented and virtual reality at Cornell Tech through course offerings, projects, and cross-campus collaborations. Our primary interests are in 3D user interfaces and interaction design for head-mounted displays. We build high-fidelity prototypes with our students through projects and coursework, and collaborate with Cornell faculty on exploratory AR/VR-related research. Harald Haraldsson.

- **Ethics and privacy**. Embedded within the progressive teaching mission of Cornell Tech, the Digital Life Initiative (DLI) was launched to analyze the societal tensions arising from existing and emergent digital technologies. Inspired by the core values of justice, democracy, privacy, responsibility, security, and freedom, DLI welcomes collaborative artistic projects that explore issues relating to ethics, policy, politics and quality of life within prevailing socio-technical systems.

- **AI, sensors and health**. The People-Aware Computing group’s research focuses on closing the sensing-to-intervention loop in health technology solutions with a special emphasis on behavioral health. We work on passive sensing of symptoms as people live their lives and provide the right level of intervention at the right time and right intensity using AI and novel actuations. We are interested in how art, dance, and music can leverage sensors and AI to create novel interventions in health. Tanzeem Choudhury. [https://health.tech.cornell.edu/](https://health.tech.cornell.edu/)

- **Robotics and human-robot interaction**. This project aims to prototype robot embodiment designs (or robot forms) for healthcare facilities from low-cost materials. Embodiment refers to the form of the robot (e.g., humanoid, animal, or non-anthropomorphic forms). The healthcare facilities explored in this work include emergency room settings, in-patient units, and long-term healthcare facilities (e.g., Coler Rehabilitation Center). This project focuses on building robot embodiments well-suited to and for users in these settings. Angelique Taylor. [https://airlab.cis.cornell.edu/](https://airlab.cis.cornell.edu/)

## > ARTIST RESPONSIBILITIES

- **Collaborate with the primary faculty member and students**. Meet with the team when on campus, and communicate with the team when off campus, to further develop the artist’s proposal, make plans, coordinate schedules, engage students, research and experiment, prototype technologies, and create the work. \Art staff can help coordinate these activities, including a kickoff meeting to share best practices for art & technology collaborations.

- **Show the work**. Translating research to impact is central to Cornell Tech’s ethos. A goal of this collaboration is to make a significant work the artist is excited to show, that makes a difference to their practice, and that is a contribution to the field. \Art will help to show the work on Cornell Tech’s campus. In addition, the artist should arrange to show the work through their own channels, e.g., at an upcoming show, in response to a biennial invitation, etc. It may also be possible for \Art to help arrange or coordinate opportunities.

- **Engage with the campus**. Over the course of the academic year, the artist is expected to participate in academic programs as reasonable and generally contribute to the art & culture of Cornell Tech’s campus. For example, the artist should give at least one talk on campus to present the results of the collaboration, could guest speak in a course or seminar series, could organize an artist panel on an emerging area of art, etc. \Art staff can help facilitate these opportunities.

- **Assist with documentation and communication**. The artist will collaborate with \Art staff to document the work for the \Art website and pursue other channels to share and discuss the work.

- **Be backslash**. This fellowship should represent something new, nonlinear, unconventional, unexpected, questionable -- for the artist’s practice, for the field -- any or all these are symptoms of being *backslash*.
