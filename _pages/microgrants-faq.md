## > \ART MICROGRANTS FAQ

Q: Can I apply with collaborators?

A: There needs to be one primary applicant since the award money will be transferred to one student's bursar account, but definitely it's great to apply as collaborators. You will see in the application a place to add your collaborators.

Q: Can I use the microgrant to pay for software?

A: Definitely! However, note that as a Cornell student you have access to many free and discounted [software licenses](https://it.cornell.edu/software-licensing/licensed-software-students), so don't pay full price if you don't have to (e.g., [Adobe's Creative Cloud for Students](https://it.cornell.edu/software-licensing/adobe-licensing-summary#section-5)).
