art-title: Pilgrimage into Walden Twelve
art-label: Pilgrimage into Walden Twelve is a live simulation software that can be run on computer and smartphone. The simulation has three distinct chapters&#58; The Honor of Shepherds, The People’s Quest, and Battle for Glorious Spells. The project is inspired by AI neural network machine learning, medieval christian indulgences mechanisms, conflicting political ideologies, popular online Chinese S&M romance novels, and the recently emerged “social credit system” in China. The simulation takes place in a medieval magical fantasy land--Walden Twelve. Walden Twelve refers to “Walden Two”, which is a utopian novel written by behavioral psychologist B. F. Skinner, a society where perfect behavior is achieved as a result of reinforced positive conditioning of the desired behaviors while meeting basic needs of citizens. During the Medieval Era, the institution interpreted the religious ideology for the people who were illiterate, which led believers to exchange money for their sins--the indulgence system. The social credit system in China is a digital indulgence system, which records big data from its citizens and rewards or punishes them according to their social credit score. In a structure similar to that of the medieval church, the Chinese government explains the Marxist doctrine to its people and has implemented the technology to enforce citizen behavior. <a href="https://www.pilgrimageintowaldentwelve.com/">pilgrimageintowaldentwelve.com</a>

sp-art-label: Three channel video. 5’20”. Singing and composition by Bibi Zhou/周笔畅. Lyrics by machine learning text generation neural networks. Voice over by Benjamin Hwang. Arrangement by Dizzla D Music. Commissioned by the UCCA Centre of Contemporary Art and supported by \Art at Cornell Tech.</p><p>The music in Aphasia is a mix of Christian Rock and romantic R&B, to worship ideologies instead of the spiritual. We used models trained to simulate the writing styles of humans--which had successfully generated text in the style of Shakespeare in the past--to generate the lyrics of the music of the video. We fed the computer to learn from B F skinner’s behaviorism theory, Chinese online novels (in the popular style/template of “Bossy, boss loves me”), and 45,000 classic romantic R&B lyrics and rapper Kanye West. Each text represented a particular ideology, those different blending of texts and ideologies achieved a unique style of writing, that is completely computer generated.</p><p>Aphasia is an inability to comprehend or formulate language because of damage to specific brain regions. The video shows the relationship between the sheep/followers and their shepherds/controllers, the dog and drone. The middle screen represents the sheep, while the screen on the left represents the dog as the the original shepherd, and the screen on the right shows the modern shepherd, which is a herding drone that can mimic the dog barking.</p><p>We asked Chinese pop star Bibi Zhou/周笔畅 to sing the the song with a romantic R&B beat according to the lyrics generated by the computer. Bibi Zhou debuted her singing career by winning the second place at the Chinese singing contest Super Girl in 2005, in which viewers are able to participate in the judging process by sending text messages with their mobile phones to vote for their favorite contestants, considered as one of the largest "democratic" voting exercises in mainland China.</p><center><p>Lyrics</p><p>Verse 1:<br>You changed my sympathy<br>I can’t face the questions<br>I’m just a behavior<br>I don’t think about her cause<br>I believe in love forever<br>So darling I love you<br>and I don’t need no conditioning<br></p><p>Chorus:<br>I want to wake up from me<br>I think I’m a process<br>This is the purpose<br>I will always be your kind contrast<br>Love is on the selection<br></p><p>Verse 2:<br>Stay with me<br>With your practical fire<br>Contact the culture that we used to be<br></p><p>Bridge:<br>Shine your autonomy on me<br>I hear the initiation coming<br>You made me feel culture<br></p><p>Chorus:<br>I want to wake up from me<br>I think I’m a process<br>This is the purpose<br>I will always be your kind contrast<br>Love is the only selection<br></center><p>Exhibited at <a href="https://www.castellodirivoli.org/en/mostra/uli_sigg/"> Castello di Rivoli, Museum of Contemporary Art</a> in Torino, Italy from February 25, 2020 to August 30, 2020, and <a href="https://ucca.org.cn/en/lab/lunar-phases/">UCCA Center for Contemporary Art</a> in Beijing, China from November 13, 2019 to December 4, 2019.
