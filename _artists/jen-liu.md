What happens if you are liquidated – financially, socially, politically, subject to climate-induced flooding? Under what conditions is it possible to survive?
 
*The Land at the Bottom of the Sea* is a live action and 3D animation video, as well as related works (painting, online media, biomaterial and sculptural objects) that consider this issue, as the last chapter of *Pink Slime Caesar Shift*, a multi-year body of work that proposed to (mis)use developments in food biotech to create alternative networks for labor activism in and around South China. This last chapter of the body of work considers several failures: the failure of Chinese labor NGO’s to survive in the face of overwhelming governmental force, the failure of techno-optimism to provide solutions to concrete environmental and social problems, and the failure of a body of art to accurately assess future possibilities. They all must come to an end, they’ve all drowned in the deeps.  

I worked with Soul Choi to build multiple NLP models based on selected bodies of text – from beauty marketing to social media of Guangdong factory workers, the models were successful but also built to fail: none can speak to a political fact that has been wiped from social memory: what happens on the day after you are politically/socially liquidated? And after that? What is the political afterlife of a dead movement? From there, Soul also researched and designed a steganographic encoder, such that thousands of images of disappeared activists I culled from the internet, can be preserved into perpetuity, no matter what is erased, censored, embedded with broken links and obsolete technology in the coming years.
