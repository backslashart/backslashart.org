In our first meeting, I asked Michael and Ben if they can hack the the Great Fire Wall, they looked at my excited face then they looked at each other and said “No.” Then, they patiently explained to me the difference between computer science and hacking. I often think of that moment and laugh at myself. I have learned so much from them and it was such a privilege to have an experience like that.

I am very proud of our final project *Pilgrimage into Walden Twelve*, all three of us see how many layers of process and labour there are in the piece. It was a great challenge to all of us, I was frustrated about learning 3D modeling and game engine but I am so glad I pushed myself.

The first chapter, *The Honor of Shepherds*, shows 6 Artificial Intelligence “social shepherds” who represent different classes: urban migrant worker, outsourced American farmer, kung fu master, Chinese hero, Bourgeois ruling class golfer, and sophisticated intelligentsia. All 6 characters have different AI brains. Each shepherd is trained on millions of examples of human-like movement patterns as a metaphor of Big Data and are scored according to a deviation from a set of ideal expressions. The Shepherds try to minimize the difference between what they believe is a correct movement to express and what is known to be the true movements shown in the data using neural network supervised learning.

In addition, the characters must learn how to act correctly, while also accounting for the natural physics in the game world. Namely, not only must they behave a certain way, they must do so while using their own natural physics. During the simulation, the system samples, and tries to determine which ones are underperforming. Those that are deemed unacceptable by the algorithm, have their neural network replaced, and the associated character model is discarded. 

The second chapter of the adventure, *The People’s Quest*, represents the inner struggle of the kingdom. It is a self-played survival game/simulation utilizing machine learning takes place in a medieval village. In Christianity, the role of the shepherd is to guide and protect the weak. Cockroaches are despicable and disposable, but are also resilient. *In People's Quest*, the shepherd AI hunts the roach AI who are trying to escape. Each round they learn from each others behaviors and will evolve their strategies.

The ultimate goal for the shepherd is to protect the roach from the ultimate danger—-capitalism demons, with the powers of Communist magic. The last chapter, *Battle for Glorious Spells*, is the outer struggle of the kingdom, a combat game engine between the different ideologies. Each attack has a unique name that is inspired by different political ideology systems and medieval fantasy games. Such as ”Class Struggle Cracking Smash”, “State Capitalism, Enforcing Flush”, “Rugged Individualism Slash”, “Nimble Chain of Social mobility”, “Bourgeois Exploitation Force”, etc. Chaotic magical effects manifest arbitrarily.

All chapters are live simulations, each time you run the software, it will appear differently. The reality of present China could be a simulated plausible future to the rest of the world.
