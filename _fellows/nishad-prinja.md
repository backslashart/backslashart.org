\Art shifted our life energy, and we learned to roll with the punches and how to handle sudden and dramatic change. I had to adapt and work with many random unrelated stresses, and as the idea forms and iterations are developed it’s so important to keep in mind that because it’s art and technology it’s going to end up beautiful no matter what.

"They Call Us A Storm" was a tightly coordinated combination of art and a political message and motion capture in performance. We show that women are nature, are the storm, and that their movements will haunt and raise the forces of nature upon those that have oppressed them and those they care for. We sent a strong message to our audience and we think it delivered as the first version and foundation of a very highly technological but human performance piece.
