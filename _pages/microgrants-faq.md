## > \ART MICROGRANTS FAQ

Q: Can I apply with collaborators?

A: There needs to be one primary applicant since the award money will be transferred to one student's bursar account, but definitely it's great to apply as collaborators. You will see in the application a place to add your collaborators.

\*\*\*

Q: Can I use the microgrant to pay for software?

A: Definitely! However, note that as a Cornell student you have access to many free and discounted [software licenses](https://it.cornell.edu/software-licensing/licensed-software-students), so don't pay full price if you don't have to (e.g., [Adobe's Creative Cloud for Students](https://it.cornell.edu/software-licensing/adobe-licensing-summary#section-5)).

\*\*\*

Q: I just got the good news! :) How do I get my money?

A: You will receive the Microgrant shortly through your student bursar account.

\*\*\*

Q: Who owns the work created with the Microgrant?

A: You own the work! This program is not a commission, and we will ask your permission before sharing your work on the \Art website, etc.

\*\*\*

Q: What should I do when Iâ€™m done?

A: Please provide pointers to your work with us so that we can share it on the \Art website.

Q: Can I apply for another \Art Microgrant?

A: Yes! You can apply again for new work. We consider each application on a rolling basis.
