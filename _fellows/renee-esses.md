\Art is a driving force to be different, surpass comfort, and explore technology as a means of self expression. Working as a technologist in the art world, I’ve learned many lessons: Be comfortable with, and almost expect, sudden changes at every step of the way. Discuss big ideas creatively, despite knowing that their implementations will likely go far beyond your technical expertise. Be confident enough in your decisions that you can instill faith in others that technology can be trusted, yet remain humble enough to know when it can’t be. And have the calm and courage to face the many challenges that come with technology and live performance.

With "They Call Us A Storm", we wanted to send a message to our audience. Throughout our creative and technical processes, this message and its portrayal have evolved dramatically, but nonetheless have maintained their core—sentimental reactions towards the world around us. 

Specifically, this piece speaks to inequality and the power of women. By introducing advanced technology to this performance, we gave the performers the freedom to express that power in their own ways—to feel the energy of the storm and contribute to it. This smooth blend of humans and technology is what made this performance so uniquely possible.
