## > APPLICATIONS

Anyone working a "backslash" project who needs support is encouraged to apply, regardless of your prior experience in art or technology.

\Art accepts student applications and awards Microgrants on a rolling basis throughout the school year.

Student applications include a written statement about the project, including its concept, material, and technologies -- and highlighting the projects originality and unconventionality. Students may apply multiple times for different projects. \Art reviews all applications and selects Microgrant recipients.

## > AWARDS

Microgrant award recipients receive $500 to help cover materials and other expenses of the project. The student is named a \Art Microgrant Awardee for the given school year. Note that this program is not a commission: the student owns the work, but we ask that the student provides pointers to their work so that we can share it on the \Art website, etc.

## > SCHEDULE

Microgrants are awarded on a rolling basis throughout the school year and students can expect to be notified within two weeks of their application submission.
