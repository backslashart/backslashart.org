The \Art experience is a project that cultimates our studies at Cornell. With little to no limitations imposed, we were free to conjure up any idea and create a piece of art that simply used technology. Then came the realization the hardest part was not solving the problem, but defining the problem. What do we want to say the most? After rounds of discussion, we arrived at the idea that the artwork be an expression of human identities.

In this digital age, it’s no secret how hard it is to escape from exposing one’s identity. You wake up, your location is tracked when you go to work, you eat at restaurants recommended to you during your morning scrolling sess, you shop at brands your internet icons shared earlier this week. Technology enables digital profiles, which can provide great convenience and joy to our lives, but at the same time can be problematic as we’ve seen some alarming scenarios unfold in front of our eyes.

The ferrofluid installation shares the vision that each of our identities is unique and beautiful, nonetheless obfuscatory. From the data source, we chose anonymous datasets that represent a variety of facets of human life. The data was shuffled, clustered and re-constructed using t-SNE and generative algorithms to create “new” synthetic humans. In the artwork, the “new humans” are manifested by the morphing shapes of the ferrofluid, symbolic of the ever-changing behaviors and experiences that technology partakes to shape and define us.
